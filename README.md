Silicon is an alternative to [Carbon](https://github.com/dawnlabs/carbon) implemented in Rust.

It can render your source code into a beautiful image.

## Why Silicon

Carbon is a wonderful tool to create a beautiful image of your source code.

But it is a web application, which brings the following disadvantages:
 - Cannot work without Internet & browser.
 - Doesn't work well with shell. (Although there is _carbon-now-cli_, its experience is not very good, especially when the network is not so good.)

However, Silicon doesn't have these problems.
It's is implemented in Rust and can work without browser & Internet.

Silicon can render your source code on the fly while _carbon-now-cli_ takes several seconds on it.

## Disadvantages

It's not as beautiful as Carbon...

## Install

### Cargo

```bash
cargo install silicon
```

NOTE: harfbuzz feature is enabled by default. If you are using Windows, I suggest you disable it to get it build easier.

### AUR

Silicon is available in the official repository:

```bash
pacman -S silicon
```

### Homebrew

You can install Silicon using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```bash
brew install silicon
```

## Dependencies

### Ubuntu
```bash
sudo apt install expat
sudo apt install libxml2-dev
sudo apt install pkg-config libasound2-dev libssl-dev cmake libfreetype6-dev libexpat1-dev libxcb-composite0-dev libharfbuzz-dev
```

### Fedora
```bash
sudo dnf install cmake expat-devel libxcb-devel freetype-devel libxml2-devel harfbuzz
```

### Arch Linux

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed pkgconf freetype2 fontconfig libxcb xclip harfbuzz
```

## Examples

Read code from file

```bash
silicon main.rs -o main.png 
```

Read code from clipboard, and copy the result image to clipboard

```bash
silicon --from-clipboard -l rs --to-clipboard
```

Specify a fallback font list and their size

```bash
silicon -o main.png -l bash -f 'Hack; SimSun=31; code2000' <<EOF
echo Hello
echo 你好
echo ∠( ᐛ 」∠)＿
EOF
```

Highlight specified line

```bash
silicon main.rs -o main.png --highlight-lines '1; 3-4'
```

Custom the image

```bash
silicon ./target/test.rs -o test.png \
    --shadow-color '#555' --background '#fff' \
    --shadow-blur-radius 30 --no-window-controls
```

Transparent background

The color can be `#RGB[A]` or `#RRGGBB[AA]`

```bash
silicon ./target/test.rs -o test.png --background '#fff0'
```

Show window title

```bash
silicon ./target/test.rs -o test.png --window-title "target/test.rs"
```

see `silicon --help` for detail

## Adding new syntaxes / themes

Silicon reads syntax-definition and theme cache from user's cache directory. 

The steps to add new syntaxes / themes is as same as bat: [sharkdp/bat#adding-new-syntaxes--language-definitions](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat#adding-new-syntaxes--language-definitions).
Just replace `bat cache --build` to `silicon --build-cache`.

## Configuration file

You can write some common args to `silicon --config-file`.

Example:
```shell
# enable shadow
--shadow-color '#555'
--background '#fff'
--shadow-blur-radius 30
--no-window-controls
```
